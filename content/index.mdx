MS Annika is a crosslink search engine based on [MS Amanda](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr500202e), aimed at identifying crosslinks of cleavable and non-cleavable crosslinkers from MS2 and MS3 spectra.

MS Annika supports identification of protein-protein crosslinks from a variety of different cross-linking reagents, including cleavable
and non-cleavable crosslinkers, and various acquisition workflows such as CID/HCD/stepped-HCD MS2 and MS2-MS3 acquisition.

MS Annika features an efficient algorithm for crosslink identification that allows for analysis of proteome-wide studies of both cleavable and non-cleavable crosslinkers on standard computer hardware.

MS Annika comes as user-friendly plugin for the proteomics platform
[Proteome Discover](https://www.thermofisher.com/at/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms/lc-ms-software/multi-omics-data-analysis/proteome-discoverer-software.html)
with a graphical user interface for easy setup and extensive documentation for customization.
