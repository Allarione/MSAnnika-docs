# Usage of MS Annika

MS Annika makes use of the workflow interface in Proteome Discoverer, which should be straight-forward to use. Step by step instructions for people
unfamiliar with Proteome Discoverer are given in the [tutorial](/tutorial). The next sections also give an overview of parameters, results, example workflows
and example data. Typically an analysis with MS Annika takes a few minutes for small samples and up to a few hours for larger samples and proteome-wide searches.
Please also refer to the specific sections for [Astral](/astral) and [timsTOF](/tims) data if you are analyzing such data.
