## General Remarks

The provided workflows also require the installation of [MS Amanda](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr500202e) which can be downloaded [here](https://ms.imp.ac.at/?action=ms-amanda).

The general processing workflow for almost any crosslink search is depicted [here](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika/blob/master/workflows/general_wf.png).

For MS2 searches (CID, ETD, HCD, stepped HCD) it can also be beneficial to employ the [IMP MS2 Spectrum Processor](https://ms.imp.ac.at/?action=spectrum-processor) node, an example workflow for Proteome Discoverer 3.0 is given here:

- DSSO MS2 search with IMP MS2 Spectrum Processor: [pdAnalysis](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika/raw/master/workflows/PD3.0/DSSO_IMP_MS2.pdAnalysis) / [zip](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika/raw/master/workflows/PD3.0/DSSO_IMP_MS2.zip)

This workflow additionally requires the installation of the [IMP MS2 Spectrum Processor](https://ms.imp.ac.at/?action=spectrum-processor) node beforehand, which can be directly downloaded from [here (Proteome Discoverer 3.0)](https://ms.imp.ac.at/?file=spectrum-processor/ms2spectrumprocessor_3.0.zip).

> [!Note]
>
> When starting these workflows you might get a warning in Proteome Discoverer that certain parameters do not exist, 
> even though all parameters are set in the workflow. This is because of different MS Annika versions that have different
> parameter sets. You can safely ignore these warnings!
